<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>An open platform for creating, distributing, and executing programs is Docker. You may<br>divide your apps from your infrastructure with the help of Docker, allowing for<br>rapid software delivery.</div><div><br></div><div>You can manage your infrastructure using Docker in the same manner<br>that you manage your apps. You may drastically shorten the time between developing<br>code and executing it in production by utilizing Docker's methodology for shipping, testing,<br>and deploying code rapidly.</div><div><br></div><div>steps to create An API is to</div><div>firstly we havet to<br>copy the code to container</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Heroku is a cloud Platform as a Service that uses containers (PaaS). Modern<br>apps are deployed, managed, and scaled by developers using Heroku. this platform provides<br>developers with the quickest route to releasing their apps onto the market since<br>it is stylish, adaptable, and simple to use.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Heroku is highly helpful to developers.<br>When it comes to beginners who want to learn about software deployment and<br>hosting, it is an excellent place to start. Heroku is free for new<br>developers. This is suitable for hosting individual projects and proof of ideas for<br>students so that is the reason why i feel heroku is choosen for<br>class.</div><div><br></div></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>A WSGI framework is what Flask is. This stands for Web Server Gateway<br>Interface, which is thankfully pronounced "whiskey." In essence, this is a method for<br>web servers to send requests to frameworks or web apps. The WSGI external<br>library and the Jinja2 template engine are prerequisites for Flask's operation.</div><div>I learned knowledge<br>about routing and modular programming.<br></div><br></td></tr>
